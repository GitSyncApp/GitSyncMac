    //try to add the long TimeBar to a ScrollView that uses snap friction, then throw it around and make it work
        //make an indicator mark that the TimeBar must align to.
        //add line sperators in the TimeBar aswell.
        //basically you need to not use the native momentum but your own. 
            //this presents a good opertunity to also try to implement transferal of velocity from native momentum
    //when valuebar settles redraw the graph

    //then try elasticView with snapfriction
