//the next experiment is:
    //The pinch gesture needs to zoom iterativly (y:2,m:1,d:0) (also Week and Hour later, maybe premium?)
    //the TimeBar needs to morph between: M,T,W,T,F,S,S and Jan,Feb,Mar, 12,13,14,15,16,17
    //when you pinch in, you record the mouse.x, and zoom into that time-range (when you zoom out this doesn't matter)
