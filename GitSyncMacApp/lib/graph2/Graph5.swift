//the next experiment is:
    //The pinch gesture needs to zoom iterativly (y:2,m:1,d:0) (also Week and Hour later, maybe premium?)
    //The TimeBar needs to morph between: M,T,W,T,F,S,S and Jan,Feb,Mar, 12,13,14,15,16,17
    //When you pinch in, you record the mouse.x, and zoom into that time-range (when you zoom out this doesn't matter)
        //When you go into the new timeUnit, you do it with a progress value attached.
            //Then you render the range for that progress val
            //you need the entire timespan for the value bar
                //
