//1. try with fake date data first (14 days at 7 days resolution)
//2. you need to adjust the graph in the visible time span. 
    //from day 5 to 12 the range is 0...122, but for 6-13 its 0...96
    //you must adjust rightBar according to the interpolated high between 2 time units. 
//3. When you zoom you reach a threshold between time units, day to hour for instance. 
    //when the threshold is reached you animate the transition in the graphLine by:
    //See old notes about day units, and how many to use. 5, 9, 6, 7, 12
    //the day GraphDot becomes the EOD in hour mode, so graphline tesselate around this point
    //The graph Dot grows in size to reveal it self 0.2 sec anim, and shrinks if removed etc.
    //The graph dots animate to their destination regardless of zooming, zoom only zooms the canvas, graph can still move.
    //
