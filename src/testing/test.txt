Hello world. 

The text item on the left is now green indicating that its new. 

A change to a file will be indicated with an orange color. like this.

Not lets see if its pushed to github?

There it is. 

In a moment or two the orange color will change back to gray. indicating that the change has also been pushed.

Lets see what happens if a co worker edits this document while you are also busy working on the document.
